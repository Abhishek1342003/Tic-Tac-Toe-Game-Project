# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed to run in the console.
The game involves two players—Player 'X' and Player 'O'—taking turns marking positions on a 3x3 grid.
The goal is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their mark before their opponent does.
